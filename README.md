# Predicting-Mental-Health-with-Brain-Network-Profiles
From: Korponay, Cole, Julia E. Cohen-Gilbert, Poornima Kumar, Nathaniel G. Harnett, Adrian A. Medina, You Cheng, Brent P. Forester et al. "Cognition-centric brain activity across diverse imaging tasks constrains the representation of mental health in task-evoked brain function." bioRxiv (2025): 2025-06.

Use tensor independent component analysis (tICA)-derived subject loadings on large-scale brain networks evoked by a range of tasks to predict mental health latent factor scores (Cognition, Positive Affect, Negative Affect, Processing Speed, Substance Use). 

Then, apply SHAP for interpretability (i.e., to determine the predictive feature importance of each brain network in each analysis). 

Training (Group 1) and Test (Group 2) datasets are provided for tutorial and replication purposes.
